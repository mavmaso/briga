# Briga
 
Itâ€™s an app for a multiplayer game that emulates a real-time fighting game, but based on cards.
The main inspiration for this game would be a mix of Street Fighter, JRPG, and Magic.

### Proposal Problem

  This app was built as a POC to learn/train liveview and get out of the comfort zone. Therefore, it was not always possible to apply the best patterns and architecture, sometimes due to lack of knowledge or to test how far a certain concept could go.But without forgetting to write clean code and do our best to deliver within the limitations.
